## Overview

The cluster operating system that I use is called [Rocks](http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/). It is one of several clusterware that is widely used, and is well maintained and regularly updated. You first need to download the ISO images, write it to a DVD, use an external DVD-ROM (or internal one if your head node has one) to start the computer.

## Head node installation

After starting up head node by the DVD drive, just follow the instructions shown in the screen to install Rocks. Nothing tricky here. The only thing that need customization are:

- Fully-qualified host name: you have to specify a host name for the server. For example, you can register a domain name such as mydomain.org, and then point a subdomain called mycluster.mydomain.org to the IP address of your cluster. Then the host name for the cluster is mycluster.mydomain.org. Depending on the friendliness of your employer, you may be able to register a subdomain such as mycluster.myuniversity.edu with your IT department, and associate an IP address with it.

- IP address: Contact your IT department to obtain a static IP address. This is extremely important! Usually they will ask for your MAC address, and make sure to provide MAC address for eth1 (not eth0!!!) to them, since eth1 is the port that is connected to Internet. The gateway and netmask and DNS server information are provided to you together with IP address.

- packages to install: select everything except kvm, bio and condor. KVM (kernel virtual machine) is probably not something that you really need. bio (bioinformatics tools) has very limited and typically outdated tools which you can install yourself easily. condor is another cluster management system that you do not need if you have SGE installed in the cluster. 

- partition: you can select automatic partition, which will work just fine. Or you can select to have 1G for `/boot`, 16G for swap, and the rest to `/`. Ideally, you would need to specify a `/export` partition but recent Rocks distributions no longer requires it (instead, it creates a symbolic link from `/export` to `/state/partition1`). Since we will be using a dedicated NFS server, it is not really necessary to have dedicated `/export`.

## Storage node

The next step is to install storage node. You can certainly install compute node next as well, it does not really matter much. You can follow the instructions for compute nodes below (except to select "NAS" as the "Appliance").

## Compute nodes

1. Place the node into the rack
2. Connect the power cord for the node to the power supply.
3. Connect the ‘eth0’ Gigabit Ethernet controller to the Gigabit Ethernet Switch in the rack.
4. Log into the frontend node and log in as ‘root’.
5. Run the program ‘insert-ethers’ command: `# insert-ethers`.  NOTE: disable iptable before run insert-ethers: `service iptables stop`. 
6. A blue screen will appear, select ‘Compute’ as the appliance and hit ‘OK’.
7. Then, the program will wait for DHCP requests from new compute node.
8. At this point you can now power on the new compute node. The new nodes boot order should be set to PXE boot first.
9. When the frontend node receives the DHCP request, it will print out something like 'compute-0-x' in the blue screen. This indicates that ‘insert-ethers’ has received the DHCP request from the compute node, inserted it into the database and updated all configuration files (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/dhcpd.conf`, DNS and batch system (SGE) files).
10. The above screen will display for a few seconds and then the “()” next to ‘compute-0-x’ indicates that the node has not yet requested a kickstart file. The above screen will be seen for each node that is successfully identified by `insert-ethers`.
11. Once the node successfully requests the kickstart file from the head node, the “()” will change to “(\*)”. If there are no more nodes to boot, then a person can quit ‘insert-ethers’ by pressing either ‘F10’ or ‘F11’. Kickstart files are retrieved via https. If there was an error during transmission, the error code will be visible instead of “\*”.
12. Once the install completes, the node(s) should be ready to use.

> Technical note: It is extremely important that the compute node is set to PXE boot first, since the head node is expecting a DHCP request from the compute node and is sending the installation package to the compute node. It is also very important that you set up a static IP address (rather than DHCP) for IPMI port in compute node (more details [here](09 Remote management.md), if you share IPMI port with eth0; otherwise, IPMI will hijack your installation by issuing a DHCP request before eth0 does.

> Troubleshooting: Sometimes all nodes fail to install with 'PXE: TFTP open time out' error message, after DHCP request is successfully made and with correct IP address is assigned. This is due to TFTP server problem in head node. I found that `service xinetd restart` (and sometimes together with `service dhcpd restart`) can solve the problem.

## Re-install nodes

When a node is shutdown suddenly, it will usually be re-installed automatically when it was started again. When a node is in error state (for example, E is shown in SGE qstat command) for unknown reason, you may want to have a fresh re-install the node manually. When you want to install new packages or updates to the cluster, you also need to re-install all compute nodes.

Use 

```
rocks list host boot
```

to check the boot action of all compute nodes. Generally, it should be "os" for all nodes.

Then use

```
rocks set host boot compute-0-0 action=install
```

to change the action to re-installation of Rocks system for the specific node.

Then if the machine is accessible, log into the machine and type `reboot`. If not accessible, just restart the machine via IPMI (see [this section](09 Remote management.md)) or manually by hand.

Alternatively, if the machine is accessible, you can just login and use `/boot/kickstart/cluster-kickstart` to reboot and re-install the node.

> Troubleshooting: When re-installation does not work

> Sometimes a node fails, and you specify to re-install the node and forced to restart the computer. However, the computer displays various error messages, such as "DHCP -/|\" hanging, or "hard drive parameter not found", or "no hard drive found". Sometimes, during Rocks install, the message "loading vmlinz...................." shows up and then freezes, or the "waiting for hardware to initialize" message that freezes. I found that all these problems were due to hard drive issues. After switching hard drive, all the issues were resolved.

## Re-install the node from hard drive

You can also force a PXE boot for a node (if it is running without issue), by logging as root, and running `/boot/kickstart/cluster-kickstart`. You will not see the command unless you are root. The node will reboot and re-install from network.

If the machine restarts but you change mind, you can unplug network cable, press ESC during the booting process, and then select the option to enter Rocks from the grub screen. After it boots into operating system, execute `/boot/kickstart/cluster-kickstart --stop` to stop booting from PXE during the next reboot.

Under the scene, for some BIOS in computer servers, if there is a any paritition info on the disk it will not fall through to pxe, even if none of the parts are bootable (so if you set up drive before PXE in the booting order, the PXE will never be used). So this command essentially change a bit in the hard drive to force a PXE boot. 


## Upgrading the system

Once a few years, we will need to upgrade the entire Rocks system to a new version. The general procedure that I used to upgrade version 5 to version 6 is detailed below.

1. Follow instructions [here](http://central6.rocksclusters.org/roll-documentation/base/6.1/upgrade-frontend.html), generate a ISO file that contains system information and burn it into CD. This is called biocluster-backup roll.
2. Install Rocks 6.1 as usual, but after selecting which rolls in the installation disk to install, supply the backup roll as well by inserting the CD into the head node.
3. After that, all compute nodes will be reinstalled automatically upon restarting, including nas-0-0.
4. Unlike compute nodes, nas-0-0 requires some manual intervention: it will ask for disk partition information. Do not change any partition, but reformat `/` and `/var` section, and do not touch anything on the LVM (in fact, I tried to mount the XFS as `/export` but it shows error message.
5. After nas-0-0 installation is done, add `/dev/mapper/nas--0--0-export /export            xfs     defaults        0 0` to /etc/fstab, so that the LVM is mounted to /export every time nas-0-0 is started.
6. Add `/export 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0(fsid=0,rw,async,insecure,no_root_squash)` to /etc/exports, so that the `/export` directory can be shared to local ib network
7. `service nfs restart` in nas-0-0, and then edit `/etc/auto.home` in biocluster to ensure using nfs protocol for mounting, then things all work now.
8. I found that if I reinstall an IBM node, then it can never be booted again by PXE (hang on “Loading from disk…”). The solution is to run these three commands in head node.

```
# rocks add bootaction action=os args="hd0" kernel="com32 chain.c32"
# rocks list bootaction
# cp /usr/share/syslinux/chain.c32 /tftpboot/pxelinux/
```

The root cause is due to specific IBM hardware configurations. See https://lists.sdsc.edu/pipermail/npaci-rocks-discussion/2012-May/057812.html for details.

9. use `qconf -me <hostname>` to modify complex_value such as as h_vmem=48G for each host. use `qconf -mq all.q` to modify the default h_vmem for each job. For some reason, these configurations are not kept during upgrading so they must be configured again.
10. Other misc changes, such as changing the way user creation is handled, etc.

## Installing login appliance

A login appliance is a host that users use to build, launch and monitor their application(s). This host is a subset of a frontend appliance (a frontend runs several other services that are used to install and maintain all the nodes in the system). The login appliance can be installed using `insert-ethers` and selecting login appliance as the type.

To add X-windows to the login device, just do a `rocks set host attr login-0-0 x11 true` and then reinstall the node. Afer testing that `startx` runs okay, you can then edit `/etc/inittab` from 3 to 5.

Some other users reported that using `yum groupinstall " X Window system"  " genome desktop"` will also work. However, this will not survive a system reinstall in the login appliance.
